# CHANGELOG — Southern Spear

**Document ID:** `Docs/CHANGELOG.md`
**Purpose:** Rolling record of what was actually done, what was actually tested, and what is still open. Appended to at the end of every work session.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-26

> **This file records evidence, not narrative.** A line here means a command was run and its result observed. If something was not done, it is not claimed. Anything marked `NOT RUN` is genuinely outstanding, not quietly skipped.

## Session 001 — 2026-09-26 — Phase 0: Audit, Architecture & Source Control

### COMPLETED

**Toolchain audit** — every claim backed by an executed command:
- UE **5.8.3** (CL 58210709, `++UE5+Release-5.8`) at `E:\Unreal\UE_5.8`
- Confirmed **Installed Build** via `Engine/Build/InstalledBuild.txt` → no engine-side C++, Lyra must be vendored
- VS Community 2022 **17.14.37710.0**, MSVC **14.44.35207** vs engine floor **14.44.34918** (thin margin, now CI-asserted)
- Blender **5.2.2 LTS**, Git **2.54.0**, git-lfs **3.7.1**
- Hardware: Ryzen 7 9800X3D (8c/16t), 31.2 GB RAM, RX 9070 XT
- Engine 5.8.3 **not** registered in the Epic Games Launcher → in-editor Fab cannot resolve it (risk R-03)

**Source control established**:
- Git repo on `main`, Unreal+Blender `.gitignore`
- Line endings pinned to LF with CRLF override for `.bat`/`.cmd`/`.ps1`
- Git LFS tracks `.uasset`/`.umap`/`.blend` and all binary art/audio types
- **LFS verified end-to-end** with `git check-attr`, not assumed

**Documents authored** (12 in `Docs/`): `PROJECT_AUDIT`, `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT`, `TECHNICAL_DESIGN_DOCUMENT`, `ASSET_REGISTER`, `LICENCE_REGISTER`, `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP`, `TEST_PLAN`, `CODING_STANDARDS`, `ASSET_NAMING_STANDARDS`, `LYRA_ADOPTION`, `DECISION_LOG` (15 ADRs), `MAPS_DRYRIVER`.

**Lyra 5.8 obtained and verified**: 20 plugins, full C++ source, 55 prebuilt binaries. Declares `EngineAssociation: "5.8"`.

**Repository relocated** to `E:\SouthernSpear` (space-free) — ADR-014.

**Dry River vertical-slice blockout generated** from a written design spec — 162 objects, 8,944 faces, 4 gameplay markers.

### FILES CHANGED

Created: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`, `Docs/*` (12 files), `Tools/Blender/dryriver_blockout.py`, `Tools/Blender/verify_dryriver.py`, `Content/Art/Blockout/*` (blend, fbx, csv), `Source/SouthernSpear*.Target.cs`.

Vendored (untracked, awaiting the G0.8 commit): Lyra source, plugins, config, content.

### TESTING

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| LFS attribute resolution | `git check-attr filter diff merge text` | **PASS** — `.uasset`/`.blend` → `lfs`, `.md` → text |
| CI workflow validity | `python -c "yaml.safe_load(...)"` | **PASS** — after fixing a real bug (Windows paths in double-quoted YAML were parsed as escape sequences) |
| Lyra editor load | read `LyraStarterGame.log` | **PASS** — all 5 game features `[Registered, Active]`, **1 error total** (`LogPixelStreaming2RTC`, cosmetic), clean exit |
| Blockout generation | `blender -b --python dryriver_blockout.py` | **PASS** — 162 objects, 0 errors, after fixing 2 bugs |
| Blockout layout | `python Tools/Blender/verify_dryriver.py` | **PASS 10/10, exit 0** |
| LFS on new binaries | `git lfs ls-files` | **PASS** — fbx + blend tracked |
| **Gate G0.8 editor build** | `Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat SouthernSpearEditor Win64 Development` | ✅ **PASS — `Result: Succeeded`, 429 actions, 0 errors, 1188 s** |
| Dedicated server build | `Build.bat SouthernSpearServer ...` | **NOT RUN** |
| Project opens in editor | — | **NOT RUN** |
| NavMesh on Dry River | — | **NOT RUN** — needs the project opened |

### ASSETS

Created (all **class F**, original, no licence obligation):
- `SS_MAP_DryRiver_01_HI.blend` — source blockout
- `SS_MAP_DryRiver_01.fbx` — game import mesh
- `SS_MAP_DryRiver_01_Layout.csv` — gameplay marker positions
- `dryriver_blockout.py` — procedural generator
- `verify_dryriver.py` — layout verifier (CI)

Vendored (licence **L-0001**): Lyra Starter Game 5.8; Unreal Engine 5.8.3 (**L-0002**).

**Licence entries added**: L-0001 through L-0012.
**Third-party assets acquired**: **zero**. Electric Dreams considered and **declined** (ADR-013).
**Remaining placeholders**: all 15 weapons, 16 of 18 characters, 9 of 13 animations, all 13 audio, all 6 effects, 11 of 12 UI, 6 of 7 maps, all 10 data assets. Nothing is final.

### RISKS

| ID | Risk | Status |
|---|---|---|
| R-01 | Lyra may not target 5.8.3 | ✅ **CLOSED** — `EngineAssociation "5.8"`, runtime log exact build match |
| R-02 | Path contains a space | ✅ **CLOSED** — relocated to `E:\SouthernSpear` (ADR-014) |
| R-03 | Engine not Launcher-registered → Fab unavailable | 🔴 **OPEN** — also gates the abandoned Electric Dreams harvest |
| R-04 | MSVC margin over engine minimum is thin | 🟡 **OPEN** — CI asserts the version |
| R-05 | 31.2 GB RAM for editor + DS + 4 clients | 🟡 **OPEN** — affects the 4-client acceptance test |
| R-06 | E: has ~488 GB free | 🟡 **OPEN** — monitor as LFS objects accumulate |
| R-07 | UE 5.8.3 is recent; ecosystem may lag | 🟡 **OPEN** — verify every plugin on 5.8 |
| R-08 | Installed Build — no engine modules | 🟡 Accepted — all divergence is project-side |
| **G0.8** | Vendored fork has never compiled | ✅ **CLOSED — `Result: Succeeded`, 0 errors** |
| **P1-01** | Editor build does not prove the project *runs* | 🔴 **OPEN — project has never been opened** |

**Network risks:** none yet — no netcode exists.
**Licensing concerns:** insignia on legal hold (L-0003); ADF marks not licensed (L-0004); prohibited sources barred (L-0007, L-0008).

### DEFECTS FOUND AND FIXED

| Defect | Severity | How found |
|---|---|---|
| CI workflow YAML unparseable — Windows paths in double-quoted strings read as escape sequences | S1 — build-breaking | `yaml.safe_load` |
| **`RunUBT.bat` does not exist in UE 5.8.3** — documented as the build command in 5 files | **S1 — build-breaking** | **Actual build attempt; only `RunUBT.sh` exists. Correct entry point is `Build.bat`** |
| Blender 5.2 cone operator takes `radius1`/`radius2`, not `radius` | S2 | Script run → TypeError |
| **OBJ A 10 m off the Y centre line** — gave one team a shorter run to the opening contest | **S2 — gameplay balance** | **`verify_dryriver.py`** |
| **Spec distances did not match generated geometry** (claimed 62 m, actual 51.9 m) | **S2 — false documentation** | **`verify_dryriver.py`** |
| Objective order (sequential vs parallel) never specified, leaving balance ambiguous | S2 — design | Verifier could not assert fairness |

**Self-inflicted process errors (recorded honestly):** reported Lyra's core plugins as "missing" when they were one directory deeper (non-recursive glob); clobbered and then duplicated a section of `DECISION_LOG.md` through several rounds of careless line-editing. Both were corrected and committed rather than quietly patched over.

### NEXT ACTION

**Open the project in the editor for the first time** and confirm it loads under its new name with all game features active — then import the Dry River FBX and generate a NavMesh. This is the first moment the project will have been *run* rather than merely *built*, and it validates the last unproven assumption left over from the fork.

## Open Threads

| Item | Blocked on | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| First editor launch of the renamed project | Nothing — do this next | Lead programmer |
| NavMesh validation for Dry River | Editor launch | Lead programmer |
| Dedicated server target build | Nothing — can run in parallel | Lead programmer |
| Fab account / engine registration (R-03) | Producer decision | Producer |
| Second client machine for 4-client test (R-05) | Producer decision | Producer |
| Insignia legal clearance (L-0003) | Legal review | Producer |

## Conventions for Future Entries

One section per work session, newest at the bottom. Always:

- **COMPLETED** — exact changes, not intentions
- **FILES CHANGED** — created/modified/removed, with the vendoring status of anything untracked
- **TESTING** — command, result, or `NOT RUN`. No exceptions
- **ASSETS** — created/imported/licence entries/placeholders remaining
- **RISKS** — new risks get IDs continuing from R-08; closed risks are struck through, not deleted
- **DEFECTS FOUND** — with how they were found, since that is the real signal
- **NEXT ACTION** — exactly one, the highest-priority item
